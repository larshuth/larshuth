### I'm @larshuth 
- straightforward student
- thoughtless theoretician
- dabbling data-analyst
- germless German

CS Theory is my soul's bread and butter but programming and data processing are nice as well.

For samples of my work please refer to my <a href="https://github.com/larshuth/WikimediaLinks-GraphOfTime">2019 bachelor thesis<a> I completed with the Goethe University's Group of Algorithm Engineering or this <a href="https://www.bundesbank.de/resource/blob/826288/d9d65905de96946a53a8254154fb6174/mL/2020-02-contract-generator-data.pdf">technical report<a> I wrote on document automation when I was at the Deutsche Bundesbank Research Data and Service Centre.
