### I'm @larshuth 
- straightforward student
- thoughtless theoretician
- dabbling data-analyst
- germless German

I usually prefer theory but programming and data processing is nice too.

For samples of my work, I refer to my <a href="https://github.com/larshuth/WikimediaLinks-GraphOfTime">2019 bachelor thesis<a> or this <a href="https://www.bundesbank.de/resource/blob/826288/d9d65905de96946a53a8254154fb6174/mL/2020-02-contract-generator-data.pdf">technical report<a> I wrote on document automation when I was at the German central bank's Research Data and Service Centre (Deutsche Bundesbank Forschungsdaten- und Servicezentrum).
